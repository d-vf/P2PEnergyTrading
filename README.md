### Matching process (double auction) | Trade generation

The double auction mechanism is used to incorporate real-world constraints on both the demand and supply sides, whereas $D$ be the set of buy orders and $S$ be the set of sell orders in a P2P market:

* Buy orders: $D = \{ (d_1, p^d_1, q^d_1), \ldots, (d_n, d^b_n, d^b_n) \}$ where each tuple represents a buy order with identifier $d_i$, a willing-to-pay price $p^d_i$, and a desired quantity $q^d_i$.
* Sell orders: $S = \{ (s_1, p^s_1, q^s_1), \ldots, (s_m, p^s_m, q^s_m) \}$ where each tuple represents a sell order with identifier $s_i$, an asking price $p^s_i$, and an available quantity $q^s_i$.

The quantities on each are adjusted at each bus $i$, ${g}_i$ (generation at bus $i$) $\equiv q^s_i$ and adjusted load at bus $i: {\rho}_i \equiv q^d_i$ (or that seller cannot sell more than ${g}_i$ and inversely, the buyer cannot buy more than ${\rho}_i$.

The matching process is described in the Algorithm "Matching_algo".

1. D = set of buy orders $(d_1, p^d_1, q^d_1), ..., (d_n, p^d_n, q^d_n)$
2. S = set of sell orders $(s_1, p^s_1, q^s_1), ..., (s_m, p^s_m, q^s_m)$
3. T = empty set (to store matches)

4. Sort D by increasing $p^d$ (price offered by buyers)
5. Sort S by decreasing $p^s$ (price offered by sellers)

**Matching Loop:**

6. For each buy order $(d_i, p^d_i, q^d_i) \in D$:
    * If $q^d_i$ (quantity demanded by buyer) is already 0, skip to the next buy order.
    * For each sell order $(s_j, p^s_j, q^s_j) \in S$:
        * Check if $q^s_j$ (quantity offered by seller) is positive and $p^d_i$ (buyer's price) is greater than or equal to $p^s_j$ (seller's price).
            * If conditions met:
                * Calculate traded quantity $q^m_ij$ as the minimum of $q^d_i and q^s_j$.
                * Create a trade tuple $t = (s_j, d_i, q^m_{ij})$. 
                * Add $t$ to the set of matches $T$.
                * Update remaining quantities:
                    * $q^d_i$ is reduced by $q^m_{ij}$.
                    * $q^s_j$ is reduced by $q^m_{ij}$.
                    * If $q^d_i$ becomes 0 after the trade, the buyer is satisfied, so move to the next buy order.

7. Calculate the total matched quantity $Q_{Total}$ by summing $q^m_{ij}$ for all trades in $T$.


A trade $t \in T$ is represented as $t = (s_t, d_t, q_t)$ where $s_t$ is the seller (source, matching $s_i$ in sell orders), $d_t$ is the buyer (destination, matching $d_i$ in buy orders), and $q_t$ is the quantity of the trade $t$. This ordering scheme simulates an optimal matching: the highest willing buyer is paired with the lowest willing seller. Each user's bid is capped by their respective load for the given time frame, while each ask is constrained by the available local generation. This ensures that the trading process accurately reflects the physical limitations of the energy system.
